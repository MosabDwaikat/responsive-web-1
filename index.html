                    <p class="article-body">Claimed by the Void when she was only a child, 
                        Kai'Sa managed to survive through sheer tenacity and strength of will. 
                        Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, 
                        the harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. 
                        Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, 
                        the time will soon come when she must decide 
                        whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, 
                        and defeat the coming darkness together… or simply to forget, 
                        as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.</p>

                            to cut down anyone who stands in her way. 
                            Xayah fights alongside her partner and lover, Rakan, to protect their dwindling tribe, 
                            and restore their race to her vision of its former glory.</p>

                            Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, 
                            the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. 
                            Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, 
                            horrifying victims and onlookers. 
                            He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, 
                            making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.</p>

                            Zed is the leader of the Order of Shadow, 
                            an organization he created with the intent of militarizing Ionia's 
                            magical and martial traditions to drive out Noxian invaders. 
                            During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow 
                            form—a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. 
                            Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything 
                            he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.</p>
