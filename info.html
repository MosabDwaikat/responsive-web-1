                <h2>The Legends of Runeterra</h2>

                <p>Composed of both the material and spirit realms, 
                    Runeterra is all that separates the celestial powers of creation from the abyssal threat of all undoing. 
                    This is a magical world unlike any other--inhabited by peoples both fierce and wondrous.</p>

                <h3>About Runeterra</h3>    
                <p>The Runeterra Universe wasn't a primary focus when the League of Legends game was created. 
                    At first, it only explained the backstories of characters to add some color into the champion 
                    that you were using rather than making them important pieces of an expanding world. 
                    As the game grew and became more popular, the players started caring more about their favorite characters 
                    and noticed that these champions had some kind of connection.</p>
                <p>
                    Riot Games decided to make the lore make more sense and started releasing champions 
                    that didn't only explain their own backstories but acted as a piece to give life to the world of Runeterra. 
                    Older characters' stories were also completely changed or rewritten to make sure that everything made sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Universe isn't limited to the game, Riot has also been releasing comics, cinematics, and recently â€“ 
                    the Arcane series that tells the stories of some of the established characters.
                </p>

                <h3>About us</h3>

                </p>
                <p>
